# Machine-Learning
My personal repository for personal notes on machine learning algorithms and coursework report from COMS30007 Machine Learning 2018.

* Data Preprocessing 
* Dimensionality Reduction
  * Principal Component Analysis
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis
* Supervised Learning
  * Regression
    * Simple Linear Regression
    * Polynomial Linear Regression
  * Classification
    * Logistic Regression (as a classifier)
    * K-NN
    * SVM
    * Naive Bayes
    * Decission Tree
    * Random Forest
