# Machine-Learning
My personal repository for personal notes on machine learning algorithms and coursework report from COMS30007 Machine Learning 2018.

The contents of this repository consist of 5 essential aspects in machine learning in the form of Jupyter Notebooks: Data Pre-processing, Dimensionality Reduction, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Deep Learning. Each notebook contain example algorithms/models along with my notes on them, detailing their process, application, advantages, and disadvantages. More topics will be uploaded soon. The

The coursework folder has my report on *Bayesian Modelling* and *Inference* with the assignment details on a separate pdf in each respective coursework folder.

Example of the topics covered within the assignment were **generative models, non-parametric learning and representation,** , **Bayesian Optimisation**, and  **Gaussian Processes** in the *Bayesian Modelling* coursework. Whilst approximate inference using **ICM, MCMC, Mean Field Variational Inference** and **Variational AutoEncoders (VAE)** were covered in the *Inference* coursework. Both report achieved high first class mark.

I've also recently setuped a blog on machine learning and AI. Head to https://fz16336.github.io/Learning-Page/ to see the progress so far. I intend to fill this blog with thought provoking articles on the history/philosophy/ and future of AI and robotics.
