# Machine-Learning
My personal repository for personal notes on machine learning algorithms and coursework report from COMS30007 Machine Learning 2018.

The contents of this repository consist of 6 essential aspects of machine learning in Jupyter Notebook. With each notebook consisting of example algorithms/models and a description, application, and pros and cons. 

* **Data Preprocessing** 
* **Dimensionality Reduction**
  * Principal Component Analysis
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis
* **Supervised Learning**
  * *Regression*
    * Simple Linear Regression
    * Polynomial Linear Regression
  * *Classification*
    * Logistic Regression (as a classifier)
    * K-NN
    * SVM
    * Naive Bayes
    * Decission Tree
    * Random Forest
* **Unsupervised Learning**
  * *Clustering*
    * K-Means Clustering
    * Hierarchical Clustering
* **Reinforcement Learning (TBA)**
* **Deep Learning**
  * Artificial Neural Network
  * Convolution Neural Network
  * Recurrent Neural Network (TBA)
  * AutoEncoders

The coursework folder has my report on *Bayesian Modelling* and *Inference* with the assignment details on a seperate pdf in each respective coursework folder. 

Example of the topics covered within the assignment were **generative models, non-parametric representation,** and  **Gaussian Processes** in the *Bayesian Modelling* coursework. Whilst approximate inference using **ICM, MCMC, Mean Field Variational Inference** and **Variational AutoEncoders (VAE)** were covered in the *Inference* coursework. Both report achieved high first class mark. 

I've also recently setuped a blog on machine learning and AI. Head to https://fz16336.github.io/Learning-Page/ to see the progress so far. This blog is meant to be a place to express my views and passion regarding the past, present, and future of AI and robotics.
