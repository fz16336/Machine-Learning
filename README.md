# Machine-Learning
My personal repository for personal notes on machine learning algorithms and coursework report from COMS30007 Machine Learning 2018.

The contents of this repository consist of 6 essential aspects of machine learning in Jupyter Notebook. With each notebook consisting of example algorithms/models and a description, application, and pros and cons. 

* Data Preprocessing 
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning (TBA)
* Deep Learning
